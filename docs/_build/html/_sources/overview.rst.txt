Overview
==============
The goal of this project is to support all endpoints available in the Terraform Cloud API. It's possible that some of these endpoints won't work if you're working against an older version of `Terraform Enterprise`<https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html>.

Note: Terraform Enterprise is the self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud. It offers enterprises a private instance of the Terraform Cloud application, with no resource limits and with additional enterprise-grade architectural features like audit logging and SAML single sign-on.
